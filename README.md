# Scratch-Project
This Scratch project is a short skit involving a penguin that walks back and forth across the beach. If clicked on, he'll say "hello" and start speaking to the user. Upon asking where he is, the user will answer by responding that the penguin is at the beach. More banter will ensue until the question of what kinds of perks happen at the beach. The user should say something about there being a lack of polar bears at the beach, thus ending the background music with a record scratch sound and the penguin stopping in his tracks. The user should follow this up with pressing the space bar, triggering the end sequence in which a polar bear attacks the penguin and the screen goes black after a comedic usage of the Super Mario Sunshine "Too Bad" theme.
